//This code appears to implement a solution to the problem of finding the number of ways to tile a rectangular grid using a set of 2x1 and 2x2 tiles. The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.

// The input to the function is an integer N representing the number of rows in the grid. The function returns the number of ways to tile the grid using the given tiles.

// The function initializes an array dp of length N + 1, and then fills in each element of the array using the following recurrence relation:

// dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3]

// The base cases are given as dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 2, and dp[3] = 5.

// It is worth noting that the values of dp[i] are taken modulo 1000000007 at each step. This is done to avoid integer overflow, since the values of dp[i] can become quite large as i increases.

// Finally, the function returns the value of dp[N] as the result.
